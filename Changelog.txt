Open Chord version 1.0.5 (2008-04-11)
=====================================

- Fixed bug 1906886: Re-joining partially destroys ring 
- Addressed bug report 1883566 	IndexOutOfBounds Exception, when SuccessorList
  capacity = 0. Open Chord cannot be initialized, when capacity of successor
  list is 0. 
- Added RMI-communication protocol (ocrmi). In order to use this protocol URLs
  must start with "ocrmi". The protocol can be changed in the console with the
  command "cprotocol -t ocrmi" before creating or joining a network. When
  compiling Open Chord do not forget to create the stub class for
  de.uniba.wiai.lspi.chord.com.rmi.RMIEndpoint with rmic!

Open Chord version 1.0.3 (2007-07-18)
=====================================

- There was a bug, when a peer P1, that has completely joined the overlay
  network, learned about a new successor P2. When P2 already had entries, the
  entries for which P1 was then responsible were left under control of P2 and
  therefore disappeared. StabilizeTask now calls notifyAndCopyEntries when the
  successor has changed to prevent this. Thank you to Frank Ruwolt for calling
  our attention to this problem.


Open Chord version 1.0.2 (2007-01-12)
=====================================

- Fixed Bug 1627751.
- Improved synchronization of data stored on a peer.
- Improved logging. 
- ant build file now creates a executable jar, that contains the
  chord.properties file.
